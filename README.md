3.Assign column names to the data

4a.Merge the activity and subject data columns with the dataset

4b.Merges the two datasets(training and testing)

5a.Read the column names to get the column names containing mean and standard deviation

5b.Create a vector defining the ID, mean and standard deviation

6.Make a subset from the merged dataset using the vector created in step 5b

7.Creating another independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

8.End result should be saved in the file TidySet.txt.
